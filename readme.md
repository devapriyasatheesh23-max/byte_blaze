### Project Description
[Digital Witness is a web-based emergency system that automatically records and uploads video evidence when the user presses an emergency button. The system captures real-time footage and stores it securely in a cloud database with a timestamp. This helps ensure quick evidence collection during critical situations]

### The Problem statement
[During incidents of harassment, accidents, or confrontations, victims often attempt to record video evidence. However, if an aggressor seizes the phone or forces the user to delete the footage, the evidence is lost forever. Furthermore, emergency responders often lack the precise, real-time location of the victim at the exact moment the incident occurs.]

### The Solution
[Digital Witness bridges this gap using a "Cloud-First" architecture. The project consists of two synchronized interfaces:

The Witness Portal (Sender): Designed with a "Zero-Friction" interface, a single tap triggers an immediate 6-second video and audio capture. Instead of saving to the phone's gallery, the video is instantly encoded into a Base64 string and pushed to a Firebase Firestore database. Simultaneously, the device's hardware-level GPS coordinates are captured and attached to the report.

The Evidence Vault (Receiver): This dashboard uses real-time listeners (onSnapshot) to monitor incoming reports. As soon as a witness begins recording, the data appears on the dashboard without a page refresh. Responders can view the video and click a dynamically generated link to open the witness's exact location in Google Maps.]
